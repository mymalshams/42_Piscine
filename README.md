The experience that I've had with the Abu Dhabi August Piscine!

The 42 Piscine is an intensive coding course that tests the student's endurance and learning capabilities within an entire month of coding.

There are no teachers, and no classes, your fronts of gaining knowledge are either the internet or your peers.

Use this as a method to learn, copy it if you have to. At least attempt to understand it at first or have your colleague explain it to you.

and don't forget, Keep Swimming!
